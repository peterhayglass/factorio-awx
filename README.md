Experimental project.

Ansible playbooks and shell scripts for use with Ansible AWX and Factorio multiplayer server, to allow doing basic server admin tasks from a convenient web interface.  

Only supports Linux at this time.  Assumes Factorio is installed as a systemd service using Bisa's factorio-init.  Also depends on the "factorio-saves" archiver service I wrote, which is also experimental and currently unreleased.   These projects may be merged in the future if they make it past the experimental phase.
